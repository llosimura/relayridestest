# Getting Started

Implement an HTML5 1-dimensional (i.e., 1-week) calendar that displays a carâ€™s availability. At a minimum:

  * The user should be able to page among the weeks
  * Page zero should be this week; the last page should be three months from now
  * The calendar should indicate dates that are not available (data below)
  * Unavailable dates should be visually distinct from dates in the past

  ```js
  var unavailableDates = [
    "2015-06-01",
    "2015-06-08",
    "2015-06-15",
    "2015-06-16",
    "2015-06-17",
    "2015-07-03",
    "2015-07-04",
    "2015-07-05",
    "2015-07-12",
